# Security Operations Cases

A collection of realistic Security Operations Center (SOC) investigation cases documenting alert triage, analysis logic, and decision-making. This repository emphasizes **SOC-grade thinking**, not tool-dependent execution.

---

## Purpose 

This repo is designed to demonstrate the analytical process of a SOC analyst. It focuses on:

- Detection hypothesis formulation  
- Log source identification and filtering  
- Aggregation and correlation logic  
- Investigation pivots  
- Decision-making for false positives, true positives, and other outcomes  
- Documentation of lessons learned

The goal is to show **operational competence** without requiring enterprise infrastructure or SIEM licenses.

## Case Template

Each case follows a consistent structure:

1. **Case Type / Alert Summary**  
2. **Detection Hypothesis**  
3. **Required Logs**  
4. **Filtering Logic**  
5. **Aggregation Logic**  
6. **Investigation Pivots**  
7. **Decision Logic**  
8. **Final Outcome**  
9. **Lessons Learned**

This ensures clarity and reproducibility for all alerts.
